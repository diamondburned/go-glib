# go-glib

See [gotk4](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4).

go-glib is only for gotk4's internal use. Most of GLib and GIO are already
autogenerated by it. As such, this repository **only** contains core types and
functions that cannot be autogenerated, which are mostly things from GObject.

Cairo GIR files are very incomplete, so they're kept here.
